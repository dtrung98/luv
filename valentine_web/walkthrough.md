# Valentine's Web Page Walkthrough

I have created a cinematic Valentine's Day web page with falling rose petals and a glassmorphism design.

## How to Run

Since this is a simple HTML/BS/JS project, you can open it directly in your browser.

**Option 1: Command Line**
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
open /Users/trungld2/Documents/Git/luv/valentine_web/index.html
```

**Option 2: Finder**
1. Navigate to `Documents/Git/luv/valentine_web`
2. Double click `index.html`

## Features
- **Cinematic Background**: High-quality dark red roses with warm lighting.
- **Falling Petals**: Procedural animation of rose petals falling and drifting.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern, frosted glass effect for the text container.
- **Interactive Bloom**: Clicking the "Click to Bloom" button accelerates the petal fall and reveals a special message.
- **Responsive**: Works on various screen sizes.

## Customization
- **Music**: You can add a music file (e.g., `song.mp3`) to the folder and update `index.html`:
  ```html
  <source src="song.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
  ```
- **Text**: Edit `index.html` to change the message.
